Description:
A classic Tic Tac Toe game, developed using JavaScript with a strong focus on DOM manipulation and event handling.
This project was a fantastic opportunity to deepen my understanding of front-end development and refine my coding skills.
Here are some of the key features:

🖱️ Interactive User Interface: The game board is dynamically generated and updated using DOM manipulation, ensuring a smooth and engaging user experience.

⚡ Event Handling: Click events are captured to allow players to place their moves, with real-time feedback and immediate response for a seamless gameplay experience.

🔄 Game Logic: Robust game logic ensures proper handling of player turns, win conditions, and draw scenarios, providing a complete and fair game flow.

✨ Responsive Design: The game is designed to be fully responsive, working flawlessly on various devices and screen sizes.

🛠️ Clean Code: Emphasis on writing clean, maintainable, and well-documented code, making it easy to understand and extend.

This project was not only fun to build but also an excellent learning experience in enhancing my JavaScript skills, especially in manipulating the DOM and handling user events effectively.
